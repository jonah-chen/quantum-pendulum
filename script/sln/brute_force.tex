\subsection{Brute Force Approach}
\begin{script}
    This is how I was taught in school two or three times. It is quite boring so I will go through it in a minute. There is no need to understand any of the math here, as they would be irrelevent for our understanding of the physical system. 
\end{script}
As we established, we only need to solve the time independent schrodinger equation. With the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian, we can write the schrodinger equation as
\begin{align}
    -\derivative{^2\psi(X)}{X^2}+X^2\psi(X)=E\psi(X)
\end{align}
Now, we evaluate the behavior as \(X\to\pm\infty.\) Then, \(X^2>>E\) so the term \(E\psi(X)\) can be neglected. The resulting equation is
\begin{align}
    -\derivative{^2\psi(X)}{X^2}+X^2\psi(X)&=0\\
    \derivative{^2\psi(X)}{X^2}&=X^2\psi(X)
\end{align}
For \(\psi(X)=e^{-X^2/2},\) the second derivative is \((X^2+1)\psi(X),\) which for \(X\to\pm\infty\) is close to \(X^2\psi(X)\). So, from this we guess the solution is in the form \(\psi(X)=u(X)e^{-X^2/2}\). Substituting into the equation yields
\begin{align}
    \derivative{}{}
\end{align}
